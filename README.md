# CodeClause_Brain_Tumor_Detection_with_Data_Science

# Important Task

as the model trained will be more than 300MB which couldnt be uploaded in git hub
so I request you to run the model training file 

./model_training/brain_tumor.ipynb

by running the above file it will save the model trained

then run app.py file to use the web app
